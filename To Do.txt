DeepCopy sucks.
	* Memoize.
	* Compute hash of all subtrees.  Requires? making ast immutable.
	
LiteralToParam Expansion powerset sucks.
	* Need a better algorithm that does not require computing all entries for k<n just to get entries for n.

LiteralToParam short circuit. - done!
	* Compare AST sizes.  If they aren't same size, then don't compare b/c the refactoring does not change the ast size.
	
Redundant work when file changes.
	* Only recompute changes.
		* Store AST of all methods.  
		* If a method has changed, just recompute that method.
		* Store extract method generated asts for all methods.
			* Regenerate the list.
			* For any that in the new list that match one from the old list, put the old list result (and it's clone instances!) into the saved bucket.
			* Recompute for all still in the old list.
